# Twilio Video React

## What is it

This application demonstrates a multi-party video application built with [twilio-video.js](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video.js) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

You must have the following installed:

* [Node.js v10+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* NPM v6+ (comes installed with newer Node versions)

## Install Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies from NPM.

If you want to use `yarn` to install dependencies, first run the [yarn import](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/import/) command. This will ensure that yarn installs the package versions that are specified in `package-lock.json`.

## How to Run

### Running a local token server

This application requires an access token to connect to a Room. The included local token [server](server.js) provides the application with access tokens. Perform the following steps to setup the local token server:

- Create an account in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
- Click on 'Settings' and take note of your Account SID.
- Create a new API Key in the [API Keys Section](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/project/api-keys) under Programmable Video Tools in the Twilio Console. Take note of the SID and Secret of the new API key.
- Store your Account SID, API Key SID, and API Key Secret in a new file called `.env` in the root level of the application (example below).

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=SKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Now the local token server (see [server.js](server.js)) can dispense Access Tokens to connect to a Room.

### Running the App locally

Run the app locally with

    $ npm start

This will start the local token server and run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in the browser.

The page will reload if you make changes to the source code in `src/`.
You will also see any linting errors in the console. Start the token server locally with

    $ npm run server

The token server runs on port 8081 and expects a `GET` request at the `/token` route with the following query parameters:

```
identity: string,  // the user's identity
roomName: string   // the room name
```

The response will be a token that can be used to connect to a room.

Try it out with this sample `curl` command:

`curl 'localhost:8081/token?identity=TestName&roomName=TestRoom'`

### Multiple Participants in a Room

If you want to see how the application behaves with multiple participants, you can simply open `localhost:3000` in multiple tabs in your browser and connect to the same room using different user names.

Additionally, if you would like to invite other participants to a room, each participant would need to have their own installation of this application and use the same room name and Account SID (the API Key and Secret can be different).

### Building

Build the React app with

    $ npm run build

This script will build the static assets for the application in the `build/` directory.
